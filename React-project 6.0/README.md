## LEARNINGS
<BR>
here we practised lists and KEYS<BR>
<BR>
We encountered a thing here<br>
whenever we return some div we have to provide a parent div to them<br>
otherwise react bura maan jata h <br>
to solve this problem we got  FRAGMENTS:

## FRAGMENTS

return (
<>                                                                      these are fragments
    <div>hi there 1
    </div>
    <div>
    hi there 2 </div>
</>                                                                     opening and closing are important ;works more like div

## Navigation in React
<br>

for navigation use

npm install react-router-dom

## BROWSERROUTER ROUTES AND ROUTE LINK
<br>
we have to import all thse in order to use easy navigation in react 

This is the order :<br>
<BROWSERROUTER>
<ROUTES>
<ROUTES>

<BR>
"Link to" : to be used highly carefully . Reason: check App.jsx<br>

## WHY NOT USE "A HREF" INSTEAD OF LINK?
 a href reloads the site and takes the user to the different page by loading<br>
 whereas <br>
LINK links the single landing page to the page we requested by clicking on the link <br>
it brings only the required page HTML and not all of them all together<br>


## useNavigate
<br>usenavigate is a hook that is used to navigate to a route 
<br> it acts like a link but is a different way to redirect

=("*") redirects all the routes except the defined one to the 404 you would like to design

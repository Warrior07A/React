## LAYOUT
<BR>
layout works as a parent of all the routes and 
<br>
the main purpose i think it damn serves
is <br>
header<br>
whatever<br>
footer<br>
this is how a website should look alike if you would add layout to top of all the routes then it would automatically add these things to every route
<br>
i.e. to every webpage header,whatever,footer would be viisible.

## UseRef

<br>
It is used as a refernce to the a particular DOM Element in short used instead of id 
<br>
for e.g. we use a document.getElementByID("input1") to get the cursor inside the input element after clicking on a button with input1 id
<br>
instead of that we can use useref hook to easily give references 
<br>

READ SLIDES:--
<br>
for e.g. a very good usecase
<br>
if you render the document.getElementByID twice then cursor will get confused where to go but if you use components then<br>
every componenet will go to its input box 





## something new
<br>
input element are self closing i.e. they dont need "</input>" just put a '/' at end.
